The only real changes between the linux and windows files is the way the color output is formed, therefore the linux version will work on
windows, however, the windows version on linux can bug out a bit.

For windows users there's a .exe file that negates the need to install the modules, just make sure you whitelist it with windows
defender otherwise it will block it because you know, it's windows defender.

Feel free to use this whenever you need.
